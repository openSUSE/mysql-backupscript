Hi

This is a very simple backup script for your mysql database.

This script expects a file /root/.my.cnf containing at least
the following information:
--------------------------[snip]
[client]
user = root
password = <password>
--------------------------[snap]

The file should be read/writeable only for root 
(-rw------- permissions).

(Note: you won't run a mysql server without a password set for 
       your administrator account!
       Try "mysql_secure_installation" to secure your 
       installation.)

Afterwards, configure your database backup via YaST2 -> 
/etc/sysconfig-Editor or edit /etc/sysconfig/mysql-backupscript 
directly with your preferred editor.

Have a lot of fun!
